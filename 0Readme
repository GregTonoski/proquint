Welcome!

The C program proquint.c converts between proquint, hex, and decimal
strings.  It compiles to the executable proquint; just type "make".

The Perl program dquad-hex converts between dotted-quads and hex
strings.  It is used in testing proquint.

Run "make clean all check" to build and check everything.  After that
you can run "make demo" for a simple demo and "make examples" for more
examples.

Enjoy.
